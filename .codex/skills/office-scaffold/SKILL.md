Check if the output file already exists. If it does, warn: "File already exists at `<path>`. Overwrite? (respond with 'yes' to confirm)"

If creating: write the appropriate template to the output path with `<slug>` replaced throughout and `<today>` replaced with today's date. Then confirm: "Scaffolded `<stage>` → `<path>`"
