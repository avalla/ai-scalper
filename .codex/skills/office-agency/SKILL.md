description: Inspect or re-profile your project agency. Usage: $office-agency [list|get <name>|profile]
disable-model-invocation: true

$ARGUMENTS format: `[list | get <name> | profile]`

- `list` (default if no args): show active agency and its agent roster
- `get <name>`: show full config for a specific agency directory
- `profile`: re-run the agency profiling interview and regenerate the agency config

Agencies directory: `.ai-office/agencies/`
Selection file: `.ai-office/agency.json`

---

## `list` (or no args)

Read `.ai-office/agency.json` to find the active agency name. Read `.ai-office/agencies/<name>/config.md`.

Output:
```
Active Agency: <name> (custom)

| Agent | Role | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| developer | Implementation | <focus> |
| qa | Quality assurance | <focus> |
...

Handoff rules: <from config>
Quality gates: <from config>

To re-profile: $office-agency profile
To inspect raw config: $office-agency get <name>
```

If no agency is configured: "No agency configured. Run `$office-setup` to create one."

---

## `get <name>`

Read all `.md` files inside `.ai-office/agencies/<name>/`. Display their contents separated by filename headings.

---

## `profile`

Re-run the agency profiling interview without touching other project settings.

Ask these questions one at a time:

### 1. Domain
"What kind of project is this?

1. Web app (frontend + backend, SaaS, dashboards)
2. Mobile app (iOS / Android / React Native)
3. API / backend service (no UI)
4. Data pipeline / analytics
5. CLI tool / developer tooling
6. Game
7. Content / media production
8. Other — describe it"

### 2. Team composition
"Who is working on this project?

1. Just me + AI (solo)
2. Small team (2–5 people) + AI
3. Larger team — AI assists specific roles"

### 3. Quality concerns
"What are the critical quality concerns? (pick all that apply, e.g. '1 3')

1. Security-sensitive (auth, payments, PII, compliance)
2. Performance-critical (latency, throughput, scale)
3. High test coverage required
4. Strong UX / accessibility standards
5. Compliance or audit trail required (SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR)
6. None in particular — standard quality"

### 4. Release cadence
"How do you ship?

1. Continuous deploy (merge to main = ship)
2. Sprint-based (weekly or biweekly releases)
3. Milestone releases (explicit version tags)"

**Agent selection rules:**

| Condition | Include agent |
|-----------|--------------|
| Always | `developer`, `qa` |
| Domain = web app or mobile | `designer` |
| Domain = web app or mobile, team > solo | `pm` |
| Quality concern = security, compliance | `security-specialist` |
| Quality concern = performance | `reviewer` (performance focus) |
| Team > solo OR milestone releases | `architect` |
| Continuous deploy OR compliance | `ops` |

Read the existing `project.config.md` for `project_name` and `agency` (slug). Overwrite `.ai-office/agencies/<slug>/config.md` with the new profile. Update `agency.json` timestamp.

Confirm:
```
✅ Agency re-profiled: <slug>

| Agent | Focus |
|-------|-------|
...

Run $office-agency list to review.
```
