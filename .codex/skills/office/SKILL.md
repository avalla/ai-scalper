## Steps

1. Read `AI-OFFICE.md` and check `.ai-office/project.config.md` when present.
2. Infer whether the user needs routing, status, task board work, milestone management, validation, setup, or a doctor check.
3. For a new feature, bug, audit, or initiative, call `$office-route`.
4. For task board mutations, prefer `$office-task-create`, `$office-task-move`, `$office-task-update`, or `$office-task-integrate`.
5. For milestone operations, call `$office-milestone`.
6. For stage readiness, call `$office-validate` or `$office-advance`.
7. For installation or configuration checks, call `$office-doctor` or `$office-setup`.
8. Prefer deterministic `ai-office` CLI commands for state mutations whenever the CLI supports the operation.
