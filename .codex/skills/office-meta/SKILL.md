description: Show installed AI Office framework version and check for updates
disable-model-invocation: true

## Steps

1. Read `.codex/skills/.version` (the installed version stamp). If it doesn't exist, report "unknown".

2. Read the framework source version from the repo root `VERSION` file (present when this repo is cloned locally). If it doesn't exist, note that the source is not available locally.

3. Compare the two versions using semver rules (major.minor.patch).

4. Output:

```
AI Office Framework

Installed version : 1.1.0
Available version : 1.1.0

Status: ✅ Up to date

Wrapper files installed: .codex/skills/ (24 expected files)
```

If installed < available:
```
Status: ⚠️  Update available (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)

To update, run:
  ./update.sh

Or ask me: "update the ai-office commands"
```

If installed version is unknown:
```
Status: ❓ Version unknown — framework may have been installed manually

To stamp the current version, run:
  ./install.sh --stamp-only
```

5. Also check: are all 24 expected wrapper files present in `.codex/skills/`? List any missing ones.

<!-- ai-office-version: 1.16.0 -->
