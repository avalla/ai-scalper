## Steps

1. **Resolve agent name**: apply the alias table above.

2. **Read personality file**: read `.ai-office/agents/<agent-name>/personality.md`.
   If it does not exist, try `.ai-office/agents/<agent-name>/`:
   - List available agents in `.ai-office/agents/` and suggest the closest match.
   - Output: `⚠️  Agent '<agent-name>' not found. Available agents: <list>`

3. **Read current pipeline state** (optional enrichment):
   - Read `.ai-office/project.config.md` → `agency`, `project_name`
   - List any `*-status.md` files in `.ai-office/docs/runbooks/` — if exactly one exists, read it and extract `State:`

4. **Display role guidance**:

   ```
   ## Role: <Agent Name>
   **Project:** <project_name> (<agency>)
   **Current stage:** <State> (from status file, or "unknown")

   ## Stage-Specific Focus
   ```

   Then append stage-specific focus based on the **current stage** (from status file):

   | Stage | Focus for this agent |
   |-------|---------------------|
   | `prd` | Define clear acceptance criteria; challenge scope creep |
   | `adr` | Document trade-offs; prefer reversible decisions |
   | `plan` | Break work into tasks ≤ 1 day; identify blockers early |
   | `dev` | Follow TDD; keep PRs small and focused |
   | `security` | Check OWASP Top 10; validate all inputs; review auth flows |
   | `qa` | Cover happy path, error paths, and edge cases; target coverage ≥ threshold |
   | `review` | Focus on correctness and maintainability; use `$office-review <path>` |
   | `user_acceptance` | Verify against acceptance criteria in PRD; test with realistic data |
   | `release` | Check rollback plan; verify feature flags; confirm monitoring in place |
   | `postmortem` | Blameless analysis; capture action items with owners and due dates |

   If the current stage doesn't match this agent's primary stage, add:
   ```
   > ℹ️  You are viewing <agent-name>'s role but the current stage is `<state>`.
   >    The active agent for `<state>` is `<responsible agent from office-advance mapping>`.
   ```

5. **Related commands**:

   - $office-validate <slug> <stage>     — run stage gate checks
   - $office-task-list                   — see active tasks for this stage
